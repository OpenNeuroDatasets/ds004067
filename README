Experiment Details

Human electroencephalography recordings from 80 participants. Participants first provided their attitudes about a set of sociopolitical issues, then view photographs of protests that were ostensibly about those same issues. Prior to each photo, they saw a pie chart indicating social support for the issue (low, medium, or high). After each photo, they indiciated their support for the protestors.

Experiment length: 1 hour.
